# ellie.js
A generic LLE (Low Level Emulation) environment written entirely in JavaScript

## TODO

- Rework the Register internals? I don't like how alias and bit/bitSet read...
- [More](https://ellieproject.github.io/ellie.js/test)/[more robust testing?](https://ellieproject.github.io/ellie.js/coverage/)
- Find a different [AVA](https://github.com/avajs/ava) to TAP to HTML test formatter? Currently using [Taplet](https://github.com/Richienb/taplet) (like [Istanbul/NYC's](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc) [HTML Reporter](https://istanbul.js.org/docs/advanced/alternative-reporters/)).
